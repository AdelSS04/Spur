This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release patched versions as soon as possible
5. Publicly disclose the vulnerability after patches are available

## Security Update Process

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1) and will be clearly marked in the CHANGELOG.md file.
